# Prediction System with FastAPI

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning prediction system built using **FastAPI**. It provides a robust and scalable API interface for deploying and serving machine learning models, allowing for easy integration into other applications. The primary goal is to offer fast and reliable predictions through a well-documented and interactive API.

## ‚ú® Features

* **FastAPI Backend**: Leverages FastAPI for building high-performance APIs with automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc).
* **Machine Learning Integration**: Seamlessly integrates a machine learning model to perform predictions.
* **Scalable**: Designed with modern best practices to be scalable and production-ready.
* **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes `.env` for managing environment variables securely.
* **Dependency Management**: Manages project dependencies efficiently using `requirements.txt`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **FastAPI**: For building the web API.
* **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
* **Machine Learning Libraries**: (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, numpy - *you can specify which ones you use here*)

## üì¶ Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fanndev/Prediction-system-FastAPI.git
    
    cd Prediction-system-FastAPI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` (if you plan to add one, or mention variables directly if not).

    ```
    # Example .env content (adjust as needed)
    # MODEL_PATH=./models/your_model.pkl
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the API

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload || uvicorn main:app --reload
